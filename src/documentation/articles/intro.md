# KEFCore: [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/ef/core/) provider for [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/)

KEFCore is the [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/ef/core/) provider for [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/).
Based on [KNet](https://github.com/masesgroup/KNet) it allows to use [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a distributed database and more.

## Scope of the project

This project aims to create a provider to access the information stored within an Apache Kafka™ cluster using the paradigm behind Entity Framework.
The project is based on available information within the official [EntityFrameworkCore repository](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore), many classes was copied from there as reported in the official documentation within the Microsoft website at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/writing-a-provider.

Currently the project tries to support, at our best, the [supported Apache Kafka™ binary distribution](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads):

| KEFCore | State | Apache Kafka™ | .NET | JVM™ |
|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| 2.6.* | Active | 4.0.* | 8+ | 17+ |
| 2.5.* | Active | 3.9.* | 8+ | 11+ |
