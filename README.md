# KEFCore: [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/ef/core/) provider for [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/)

KEFCore is the [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/ef/core/) provider for [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/).
Based on [KNet](https://github.com/masesgroup/KNet) it allows to use [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/) as a distributed database and more.

### Project disclaimer

KEFCore is a project, curated by MASES Group, can be supported by the open-source community.

Its primary scope is to support other, public or internal, MASES Group projects: open-source community and commercial entities can use it for their needs and support this project, moreover there are dedicated community and commercial subscription plans.

The repository code and releases may contain bugs, the release cycle depends from critical discovered issues and/or enhancement requested from this or other projects.

Looking for the help of [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/ef/core/) and [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/) experts? MASES Group can help you design, build, deploy, and manage [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/it-it/ef/core/) and [Apache Kafka™](https://kafka.apache.org/) applications.

## Scope of the project

This project aims to create a provider to access the information stored within an Apache Kafka™ cluster using the paradigm behind Entity Framework.
The project is based on available information within the official [EntityFrameworkCore repository](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore), many classes was copied from there as reported in the official documentation within the Microsoft website at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/writing-a-provider.

Currently the project tries to support, at our best, the [supported Apache Kafka™ binary distribution](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads):

| KEFCore | State | Apache Kafka™ | .NET | JVM |
|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| 2.6.* | Active | 4.0.* | 8+ | 17+ |
| 2.5.* | Active | 3.9.* | 8+ | 11+ |

## Runtime engine

KEFCore uses [KNet](https://github.com/masesgroup/KNet), and indeed [JCOBridge](https://www.jcobridge.com) with its [features](https://www.jcobridge.com/features/), to obtain many benefits:
* **Cyber-security**:
  * [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) and [CLR, or CoreCLR,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime) runs in the same process, but are insulated from each other;
  * JCOBridge does not make any code injection into JVM;
  * JCOBridge does not use any other communication mechanism than JNI;
  * .NET (CLR) inherently inherits the cyber-security levels of running JVM and Apache Kafka™; 
* **Direct access the JVM from any .NET application**: 
  * Any Java/Scala class behind Apache Kafka™ can be directly managed: Consumer, Producer, Administration, Streams, Server-side, and so on;
  * No need to learn new APIs: we try to expose the same APIs in C# style;
  * No extra validation cycle on protocol and functionality: bug fix, improvements, new features are immediately available;
  * Documentation is shared.
